 - / -> forwards either to /login or /dashboard
 - /logout -> logs out user -> /
 - /login -> / or whatever URL they had attempted while logged out

/dashboard

   - role
   - number of resources
 - control plane operations
   - /server/pause
   - /server/resume
   - /server/stop
 - configuration management
   - /server/configuration
   - /server/configuration/add
   - /server/configuration/update

/resources
 - maybe two views (because showing them together is hard/impossible?)...
 - logical tree view
   - https://docs.irods.org/4.2.8/plugins/composable_resources/
   - ability to edit the tree
     - add to parent, remove from parent
 - physical - just a table view - grouped by server?
 - /resource/create
 - /resource/remove
    when things in it(show the error code)
 - /resource/update
   - name, type, host, path, status, comment, info, free_space, context_string

/delay_queue
 - listing

/policy
 - eventually will show and edit policy/policies
 - rule execution, pool, can run a single one, with inputs...
 - rule engine plugins
 - perhaps with versioning
 - perhaps in a pool... to be deployed to particular servers
 - but this can all come later, we don't know yet
